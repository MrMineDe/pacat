.LP
\fIpakt-dry \fB-Q\fR [(package|category) ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
pakt-sync is a pakt suite script responsible for installing packages from list files, including your category files. Thus, it fulfills one of the purposes for categories in the first place, trying to kind of emulate NixOS' functionality.

You can either pass files by using the same plus character syntax as in pakt or giving a file path.

To look up the category syntax, see \fBpakt\fR(1).

.SH OPTIONS

       Shows this man page.

\fB-S\fR, \fB--sync\fR

.br
       but no packages will be installed.

\fB-R\fR, \fB--remove\fR
.br
       Performs the same category deletion as when uninstalling packages with pakt
.br
       but no packages will be uninstalled.

\fB-Q\fR, \fB--query\fR
.br

\fIpakt-dry\fR +core,cli ~/Documents/arch_stuff.txt
.br
       Besides the former action, also prints out the contents of \fI~/Documents/arch_stuff.txt\fR.

\fIpakt-dry\fR -a neovim +core,cli,dev
.br
       Assigns neovim to the categories \fBcore\fR, \fBcli\fR and \fBdev\fR, regardless whether
.br
       neovim is actually installed.

\fIpakt-dry\fR -r neovim +dev

.br
       it was installed before.
